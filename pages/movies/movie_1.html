         <p><b>Description:</b></p>
         <p>
            After more than 30 years of service as one of the Navy's top
            aviators, Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the
            envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in
            rank that would ground him. Training a detachment of graduates for a
            special assignment, Maverick must confront the ghosts of his past
            and his deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the
            ultimate sacrifice from those who choose to fly it.
